/**
 *  In the waypoint mission, the aircraft will travel between waypoints, execute
 *  actions at waypoints, and adjust heading and altitude between waypoints.
 *  Waypoints are physical locations to which the aircraft will fly. Creating a
 *  series of waypoints, in effect, will program a flight route for the aircraft
 *  to follow. Actions can also be added to waypoints, which will be carried out
 *  when the aircraft reaches the waypoint.
 *
 *  The aircraft travels between waypoints automatically at a base speed.
 *  However, the user can change the speed by using the pitch joystick. If the
 *  stick is pushed up, the speed will increase. If the stick is pushed down,
 *  the speed will slow down. The stick can be pushed down to stop the aircraft
 *  and further pushed to start making the aircraft travel back along the path
 *  it came. When the aircraft is traveling through waypoints in the reverse
 *  order, it will not execute waypoint actions at each waypoint. If the stick
 *  is released, the aircraft will again travel through the waypoints in the
 *  original order, and continue to execute waypoint actions (even if executed
 *  previously).
 *
 *  If the aircraft is pulled back along the waypoint mission all the way to the
 *  first waypoint, then it will hover in place until the stick is released
 *  enough for it to again progress through the mission from start to finish.
