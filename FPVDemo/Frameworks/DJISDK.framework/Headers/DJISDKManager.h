 *  them with the product's flight logs (stored on the product) to better understand the root cause of a crash and determine whether the incident
 *  is covered under warranty. They can also be used by developers to debug their application.
 *
 *  SDK Logs record commands from the application to the SDK, and information from the SDK to the application that are related to flight.
 *  Logs are cached to the mobile device, and will overwrite themselves to limit storage footprint.
 *  `archiveLogs` will move the logs to an archive folder. Logs in the archive, will only be overwritten by newer archives that go beyond the storage
 *  limit and not normal log generation. The storage limit for normal log generation is 400 MB (about 500 minutes of flight). The storage limit for the archive
 *  is an additional 400 MB.
 *
 *  The logs have an encrypted and unencrypted portion. The unencrypted portion can be used by developers to see all commands and information
 *  sent to and received from the SDK by the mobile application that is related to flight. The encrypted portion can only be used by a DJI service facility
 *  as it includes proprietary hardware protocols and is used to tie the SDK logs and product flight logs together.
 *
 *  Logs can be transferred to the DJI service facility either by manually downloading from the mobile device using iTunes, or
 *  the application can send archived logs to a DJI endpoint using `uploadArchive`. Developers should be careful to upload logs directly
 *  when the user is on a cellular connection as the archive can be up to 400 MB.
